# cse3150_week_3_hw

I used pointers to pass arrays and variables to and from functions such as addStudent so that I could compartmentalize functionality in my program
nullptr was handy when checking if the passed gpaPtr actually pointed to something in updateGPA

I used const to protect arguments from manipulation

I used references where I needed to pass a number from main into a function without creating a copy, such as with size in addStudent

I used casting to convert some input into workable data as well as to convert from a double to an integer when printing the average gpa

I used exceptions when calling all of my functions to protect against unwanted behaviour

I used if/else in a similar way
